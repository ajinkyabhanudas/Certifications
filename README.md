# Specializations

## 1. Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine 
- The Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine specialization will teach you how to implement 
solutions using Google Kubernetes Engine, or GKE, including building, scheduling, load balancing, 
and monitoring workloads, as well as providing for discovery of services, managing role-based 
access control and security, and providing persistent storage to these applications.

## 2. Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform
- This five-course online specialization teaches course participants how to write distributed 
machine learning models that scale in Tensorflow, scale out the training of those models. and 
offer high- performance predictions. Also featured is the conversion of raw data to features 
in a way that allows ML to learn important characteristics from the data and bring human 
insight to bear on the problem. It also teaches how to incorporate the right mix of parameters 
that yields accurate, generalized models and knowledge of the theory to solve specific types 
of ML problems. Course participants experimented with end-to-end ML, starting from building an 
ML-focused strategy and progressing into model training, optimization, and productionalization 
with hands- on labs using Google Cloud Platform.

## 3. Networking in Google Cloud
- In this three-course accelerated specialization, learners explored and deployed GCP networking 
technologies, such as Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks, subnets, firewalls; 
interconnection among networks; load balancing; Cloud DNS; Cloud CDN; common network design 
patterns and automated deployments using Deployment Manager.

## 4. Applied Data Science with Python
- The 5 courses in this University of Michigan specialization introduce learners to data science 
through the python programming language. This skills-based specialization is intended for learners 
who have a basic python or programming background, and want to apply statistical, machine learning, 
information visualization, and text analysis techniques to gain new insight into their data. In the 
final course, students will work on real-world data analysis projects, building a portfolio which 
showcases their work while at the same time helping real clients gain a better understanding of 
their data.

## 5. Deep Learning
- The Deep Learning Specialization is designed to prepare learners to participate in the development 
of cutting-edge AI technology, and to understand the capability, the challenges, and the consequences 
of the rise of deep learning. Through five interconnected courses, learners develop a profound 
knowledge of the hottest AI algorithms, mastering deep learning from its foundations (neural networks) 
to its industry applications (Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, etc.).
